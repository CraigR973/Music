            <p>Strathclyde University Concert Band is a large band, open to all woodwind and brass, percussion or string bass players of all abilities.</p>

            <p>It prides itself in being completely open - so no auditions!  And if you would like to come along but don't have your own instrument, get in touch as the Uni has a number of instruments available for students to borrow: bass clarinet, baritone saxophone, bassoon, tenor horn, French horn, euphonium, tuba and percussion.</p>

            <p>Each year, the band pulls off some great performances at venues such as the Barony Hall and the Winter Gardens of the People's Palace (Glasgow Green).</p>

            <p>However, the other side of the band is its unique, vibrant and colourful post-rehearsal/concert scene, involving a pub, to which everyone is wholeheartedly encouraged to attend!</p>

            <p>We meet on Thursday evenings, 5:30-7:30pm, with post-rehearsal socials afterwards in Bar Home on Albion Street.</p>
